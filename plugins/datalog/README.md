# KOSTAL

# Requirements

Plugin to dump the item data into files on the file system. It can be used
to configure different logs and log patterns and assign them to the
items. These items will be logged to the files.

## Supported Hardware

No special hardware required.

# Configuration

## plugin.conf

The plugin can be configured using the following settings:

<pre>
[datalog]
   class_name = DataLog
   class_path = plugins.datalog
#   path = var/log/data
#   filepatterns = default:{log}-{year}-{month}-{day}.csv | yearly:{log}-{year}.csv
#   logpatterns = csv:{time};{item};{value}\n
#   cycle = 300
</pre>

This will setup the logs `default` and `yearly`, which is using the configured
patter to build the target file name (key-value pairs). The `default` log is
configured automatically if you do not specify any file patterns.

Additionally the patterns to use to log the data into the files is configured
also configured there. The key-value pairs are specifying the file extension
and the log pattern to use. In this example all log files having the extension
`.csv` will be logged using the configured pattern. This is also the default
if you do not specify any log patterns. in the configuration.

Both settings can make use of some placeholders (see below).

The path paramter can be used to log into a different path intead of the default
path and the cycle parameter defines the interval to use to dump the data
into the log files, which defaults to 300 seconds.

Placeholders which can be used in the `logpatterns` option:

   * `time` - the string representation of the time
   * `stamp` - the unix timestamp of the time
   * `item` - the id of the item
   * `value` - the value of items

## items.conf

### path

Specifies the path to log into. The default value is `var/log/data` which can
be changed by using this option. All log files will be logged into this directory.
It's not possible to configure different log paths for different log files.

### filepatterns

This specifies a list of file patterns, which is used to build the target files
to log data into. It's using a key-value pair syntax, which means you can
configure multiple file patterns or log files.

Placeholders which can be used in the `filepatterns` option:

   * `log` - specifies the type of log (e.g. "default" in the example above)
   * `year` - the current year
   * `month` - the current month
   * `day` - the current day

### logpatterns

The log pattners setting configured the format in which the data will be
logged into the log files. It's using a key-value pair syntax, which means
you can configure multiple log patterns.

A log pattern is used for logging when a file pattern is configured, where
the extension (part behind the last `.`) matches the key.

Example:
<pre>
[datalog]
   class_name = DataLog
   class_path = plugins.datalog
   filepatterns = default:{log}-{year}-{month}-{day}.csv | custom:{log}-{year}-{month}-{day}.txt
   logpatterns = csv:{time};{item};{value}\n
</pre>

In this example the `default` log file will use the configured log pattern. The
`custom` log file is completely ignored, since no pattern is configured.

### Example

Example configuration using the plugin configuration on top of the page.

<pre>
# items/my.conf
[some]
    [[item1]]
        type = str
        datalog = default
    [[item2]]
        type = num
        datalog = default | custom
    [[item3]]
        type = num
        datalog = custom
</pre>

This will log the items

   * `some.item1` to the `default` log
   * `some.item2` to the `default` and `custom` log 
   * `some.item3` to the `custom` log
