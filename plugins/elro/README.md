# Elro

# Description

You can use this Plugin to control elro (or elro-based) remote-control-switches (rc-switches). If the backend-server uses the same command-syntax as the rc_switch_server project, you can even control non-elro rc-switches too! (Or everything other that can be switched on and off)

For rc_switch_server command-syntax look at https://github.com/Brootux/rc_switch_server.py (Server-Clients)

# Requirements

  * Installed and running rc_switch_server (https://github.com/Brootux/rc_switch_server.py)

# Configuration
## plugin.conf

You have to just simply copy the following into your plugin.conf file. The ip-address/hostname of the rc_switch_server has to be setup later in the items.conf!

<pre>
[elro]
    class_name = Elro
    class_path = plugins.elro
</pre>

## items.conf

The most item-fields of this plugin are mandatory. So you should always use all of the fields showed in the following example.

### Example

<pre>
# items/rc_switches.conf
[RCS]
	type = str
	elro_host = localhost
	elro_port = 6700
    [[A]]
        type = bool
        elro_system_code = 0.0.0.0.1
        elro_unit_code = 1
        elro_send = value
        enforce_updates = yes
        visu_acl = rw
    [[B]]
        type = bool
        elro_system_code = 0.0.0.0.1
        elro_unit_code = 2
        elro_send = value
        enforce_updates = yes
        visu_acl = rw
    [[C]]
        type = bool
        elro_system_code = 0.0.0.0.1
        elro_unit_code = 4
        elro_send = value
        enforce_updates = yes
        visu_acl = rw
    [[D]]
        type = bool
        elro_system_code = 0.0.0.0.1
        elro_unit_code = 8
        elro_send = value
        enforce_updates = yes
        visu_acl = rw
</pre>

Description of the attributes:

* __elro_host__: the ip-address/hostname of the rc_switch_server (mandatory)
* __elro_port__: the port of the rc_switch_server
* __elro_system_code__: the code of your home (mandatory)
* __elro_unit_code__: the code of the unit, you want to switch (mandatory)
* __elro_send__: use always "value" here (mandatory)

Hints:
* __You have to setup the items as showed in a tree structure with the `elro_host` as its root!__ (The tree can be a subtree of a greater tree but always has to be `elro_host` as a attribute of the root item)
* For __elro_system_code__ you have to set the correct bits of you code (no conversion)
* For __elro_unit_code__ you have to convert your settings to binary (A = 1, B = 2, C = 4, D = 8, ...)
* For __elro_send__ always use the transmitting of a value per button (because sometimes the signals dont get transported correctly from remote-transmitter, so you should have the chance to send "on" or "off" more than once)

### Example for multiple rc_switch_server´s

<pre>
# items/rc_switches.conf
[RCS-1]
	type = str
	elro_host = localhost
	elro_port = 6700
    [[A]]
        type = bool
        elro_system_code = 0.0.0.0.1
        elro_unit_code = 1
        elro_send = value
        enforce_updates = yes
        visu_acl = rw
    ...
    
[RCS-2]
	type = str
	elro_host = 192.168.0.100
	elro_port = 6666
    [[A]]
        type = bool
        elro_system_code = 0.0.0.0.2
        elro_unit_code = 1
        elro_send = value
        enforce_updates = yes
        visu_acl = rw
    ...
</pre>

## SmartVisu

I suggest you to use the following setup per rc-switch:


```html
<span data-role="controlgroup" data-type="horizontal">
	<h3>TV-Center</h3>
	{{ basic.button('rcs_tv_on', 'RCS.A', 'On', '', '1', 'midi') }}
	{{ basic.button('rcs_tv_off', 'RCS.A', 'Off', '', '0', 'midi') }}
</span>
```
