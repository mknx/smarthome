# FritzBox

# Requirements
This plugin has no requirements or dependencies.
At the moment only fritzbox firmware versions after 5.50 are supported.

I have tested it with my FritzBox 7390 and FritzOS 06.03.

# Configuration

## plugin.conf
<pre>
[fritzbox]
    class_name = FritzBox
    class_path = plugins.fritzbox
    username = secret
    password = secret
#   host = fritz.box
#   cycle = 300
</pre>

### Attributes
  * `username`/password`: required login information
  * `host`: specifies the hostname or ip address of the FritzBox.
  * `cycle`: timeperiod between two update cycles. Default is 300 seconds.

</pre>

## logic.conf
If you specify `fritzbox = callmonitor` your logic will be called at every call event of your FritzBox. Have a look at the trigger['value'] for information about the event.
You have to enable the monitor of your FritzBox by calling `#96*5*` from your phone. You could disable it with `#96*4*`.

<pre>
[Callmonitor]
    filename = callmonitor.py
    fritzbox = callmonitor
</pre>

# Functions

## call(from, to)
This function calls a specified number from the specified caller. If your calling external numbers, you could speed up the dial process by appending a `#` to the to-number.
<pre>
sh.fritzbox.call('**610', '**611')
</pre>

## calllist()
This function returns a list of all calls.

## reboot()
This function reboots the FritzBox.

## reconnect()
This function reconnect the upstream connection.
